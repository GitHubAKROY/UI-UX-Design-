Description:

Project: Office Rental Website & App

A Figma prototype for a platform (website + mobile app) for office space rentals. The design aims to help businesses, freelancers, or remote workers find and rent office spaces, coworking areas, or meeting rooms with ease. It blends listing discovery, booking flows, and user-management into a clean, intuitive UI/UX.

Key Features / Components

Space Listings / Discovery
Users can browse available office spaces, coworking spots, or meeting rooms with key details: location, type of space, photos, pricing, amenities, availability.

Search & Filters
Robust search functionality (e.g. by city, neighbourhood, price range, capacity, amenities like WiFi, parking, internet) so users can narrow down options that match their needs.

Map & Location Views
Showing offices on a map to help see geographical options; possibly distance or directions, neighbourhood context.

Space Detail View
When selecting a listing: large images of the space, detailed descriptions, amenities, availability calendar or schedule, terms, pricing, maybe reviews.

Booking / Reservation Flow
Screens to select dates/times, choose space type, make reservations, payment workflows, confirmation of booking.

User Profile / Account Management
Users: profile with past bookings, favourites/saved spaces, payment method, settings. Hosts (if included) may manage their listings.

Contact / Support
Options to contact space owners / hosts, support for issues, maybe messaging or inquiry forms.

Responsive Design / Multi-Platform
Layouts optimized for both desktop (website) and mobile (app) usage; consistency in UI elements and interactions across platforms.

Promotions / Special Offers
Might include featured spaces, discounts, promotions, or “popular in area” highlights.

Visual / UI & UX Style

Clean, professional, modern aesthetic. Probably using large imagery, good use of whitespace, clear typographic hierarchy to distinguish space name, price, amenities, etc.

Color scheme and UI elements that convey trust and clarity (e.g. neutral tones, accent colors for call-to-actions like “Book Now”).

Intuitive navigation: easy to switch between map view/list view, filtering, calendar/availability.

Use of visual cues for availability status, pricing transparency, and photos to help users make decisions.

Purpose & Goals

To design a user-friendly platform for finding & booking office spaces, useful for remote/local professionals and businesses seeking flexible workspace.

To reduce friction in the rental process: allow users to quickly compare, select, and reserve spaces.

To demonstrate full design flows across devices: discovery, detailed info, booking, and account management.
